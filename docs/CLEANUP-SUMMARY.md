# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### Organized Structure
- Created `docs/` folder for all documentation
- Kept `README.md` in root as main entry point
- Moved all other documentation to `docs/`

### Removed Duplicates and Development History
**Deleted files (development history/duplicates):**
- `CLI-IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Development history of CLI features
- `POSITIONAL-ARGS.md` - Development history of argument parsing
- `BACK-NAVIGATION.md` - Development history of back functionality
- `REGION-CHANGE.md` - Superseded by better implementation
- `REGION-SUPPORT.md` - Duplicate content

### Consolidated Essential Documentation

**Final structure:**
```
├── README.md                 # Main user documentation (root)
└── docs/
    ├── README.md            # Documentation index
    ├── AWS-SETUP.md         # AWS configuration guide
    ├── USAGE.md             # Advanced features and workflows  
    ├── DEVELOPER.md         # Technical architecture
    ├── TESTING.md           # Test coverage info
    └── DEPLOYMENT.md        # Build and release guide
```

### Content Focus
- **Removed**: Development history, duplicate explanations, verbose technical details

## Documentation Quality

### Before Cleanup

- Development history mixed with user documentation
- Duplicate explanations of same features

### After Cleanup
